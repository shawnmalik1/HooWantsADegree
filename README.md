## Next Steps 👀

- For the purpose of the hackathon, we limited our scope to UVA engineering. With more time we would increase our scope to all majors and schools at UVA, and eventually every school in the country. We would also optimize the dataset in which we trained the AI to give more accurate/streamlined plans, professor suggestions, and scheduling for the upcoming semester!
